<p> <strong>Goa</strong>, state of India, comprising a mainland district
	 on the country’s southwestern coast and an offshore
	 island. It is located about 250 miles (400 km) sout
	 h of Mumbai (Bombay). One of India’s smallest state
	 s, it is bounded by the states of Maharashtra on th
	 e north and Karnataka on the east and south and by
	 the Arabian Sea on the west. The capital is Panaji (
	 Panjim), on the north-central coast of the mainland d
	 istrict. Formerly a Portuguese possession, it became
	 a part of India in 1962 and attained statehood in 1987
	 . Area 1,429 square miles (3,702 square km). Pop. (201
	 1) 1,457,723.
</p>
<p>The Portuguese colonial heritage and the diverse loca
	l population of Goa have cultivated a unique cultural l
	andscape. The population is primarily a mixture of Chris
	tians and Hindus: the western coastland and estuaries a
	re dotted with wayside crosses and Roman Catholic church
	es, while the hilly east is scattered with Hindu temples
	 and shrines. There is also a notable Muslim population
	 in Goa, as well as smaller communities of Jains, Sikhs
	 , and practitioners of local religions. Portuguese was
	  once the language of the administration and the elite
		, and as part of that legacy, many Goans bear Portuguese
		personal names and surnames. Today, however, most Goans
		tend to speak Konkani, Marathi, or English.
